Creates an array of `n`-tuples of consecutive elements.

- Use `Array.prototype.slice()` and `Array.prototype.map()` to create an array of appropriate length.
- Populate the array with `n`-tuples of consecutive elements from `arr`.
- If `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, return an empty array.
