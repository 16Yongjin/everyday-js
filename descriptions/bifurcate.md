Splits values into two groups, based on the result of the given `filter` array.

- Use `Array.prototype.reduce()` and `Array.prototype.push()` to add elements to groups, based on `filter`.
- If `filter` has a truthy value for any element, add it to the first group, otherwise add it to the second group.
