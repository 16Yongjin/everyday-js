Finds the index of a given element in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm.

- Declare the left and right search boundaries, `l` and `r`, initialized to `0` and the `length` of the array respectively.
- Use a `while` loop to repeatedly narrow down the search subarray, using `Math.floor()` to cut it in half.
- Return the index of the element if found, otherwise return `-1`.
- **Note:** Does not account for duplicate values in the array.
