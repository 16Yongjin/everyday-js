Sorts an array of numbers, using the bubble sort algorithm.

- Declare a variable, `swapped`, that indicates if any values were swapped during the current iteration.
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to clone the original array, `arr`.
- Use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the cloned array, terminating before the last element.
- Use a nested `for` loop to iterate over the segment of the array between `0` and `i`, swapping any adjacent out of order elements and setting `swapped` to `true`.
- If `swapped` is `false` after an iteration, no more changes are needed, so the cloned array is returned.
