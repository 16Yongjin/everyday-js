Accepts a converging function and a list of branching functions and returns a function that applies each branching function to the arguments and the results of the branching functions are passed as arguments to the converging function.

- Use `Array.prototype.map()` and `Function.prototype.apply()` to apply each function to the given arguments.
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to call `converger` with the results of all other functions.
