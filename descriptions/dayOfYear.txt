Gets the day of the year (number in the range 1-366) from a `Date` object.

- Use the `Date` constructor and `Date.prototype.getFullYear()` to get the first day of the year as a `Date` object.
- Subtract the first day of the year from `date` and divide with the milliseconds in each day to get the result.
- Use `Math.floor()` to appropriately round the resulting day count to an integer.
