Creates a deep clone of an object.
Clones primitives, arrays and objects, excluding class instances.

- Use recursion.
- Check if the passed object is `null` and, if so, return `null`.
- Use `Object.assign()` and an empty object (`{}`) to create a shallow clone of the original.
- Use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()` to determine which key-value pairs need to be deep cloned.
- If the object is an `Array`, set the `clone`'s `length` to that of the original and use `Array.from()` to create a clone.
