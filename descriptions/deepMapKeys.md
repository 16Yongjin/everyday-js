Deep maps an object's keys.

- Creates an object with the same values as the provided object and keys generated by running the provided function for each key.
- Use `Object.keys()` to iterate over the object's keys.
- Use `Array.prototype.reduce()` to create a new object with the same values and mapped keys using `fn`.
