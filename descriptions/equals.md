Performs a deep comparison between two values to determine if they are equivalent.

- Check if the two values are identical.
- Check if both values are `Date` objects with the same time, using `Date.prototype.getTime()`.
- Check if both values are non-object values with an equivalent value (strict comparison).
- Check if only one value is `null` or `undefined` or if their prototypes differ.
- If none of the above conditions are met, use `Object.keys()` to check if both values have the same number of keys.
- Use `Array.prototype.every()` to check if every key in `a` exists in `b` and if they are equivalent by calling `equals()` recursively.
