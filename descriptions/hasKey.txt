Checks if the target value exists in a JSON object.

- Check if `keys` is non-empty and use `Array.prototype.every()` to sequentially check its keys to internal depth of the object, `obj`.
- Use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` to check if `obj` does not have the current key or is not an object, stop propagation and return `false`.
- Otherwise assign the key's value to `obj` to use on the next iteration.
- Return `false` beforehand if given key list is empty.
