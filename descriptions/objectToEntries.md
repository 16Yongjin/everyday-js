Creates an array of key-value pair arrays from an object.

- Use `Object.keys()` and `Array.prototype.map()` to iterate over the object's keys and produce an array with key-value pairs.
- [`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries) provides similar functionality.
