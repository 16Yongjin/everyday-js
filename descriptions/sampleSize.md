Gets `n` random elements at unique keys from an array up to the size of the array.

- Shuffle the array using the [Fisher-Yates algorithm](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code#shuffle).
- Use `Array.prototype.slice()` to get the first `n` elements.
- Omit the second argument, `n`, to get only one element at random from the array.
