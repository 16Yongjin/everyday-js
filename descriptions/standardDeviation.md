Calculates the standard deviation of an array of numbers.

- Use `Array.prototype.reduce()` to calculate the mean, variance and the sum of the variance of the values and determine the standard deviation.
- Omit the second argument, `usePopulation`, to get the sample standard deviation or set it to `true` to get the population standard deviation.
