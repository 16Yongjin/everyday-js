Checks if the first iterable is a subset of the second one, excluding duplicate values.

- Use the `Set` constructor to create a new `Set` object from each iterable.
- Use `Array.prototype.every()` and `Set.prototype.has()` to check that each value in the first iterable is contained in the second one.
