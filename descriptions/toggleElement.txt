Removes an element from an array if it's included in the array, or pushes it to the array if it isn't.

- Use `Array.prototype.includes()` to check if the given element is in the array.
- Use `Array.prototype.filter()` to remove the element if it's in the array.
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to push the element if it's not in the array.
